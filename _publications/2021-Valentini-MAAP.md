Highlights
• MAAP sample spots were analysed off-line by a benchtop multi-λ polar photometer.
• The effect of different assumptions in MAAP radiative transfer scheme was tested.
• A fixed blank spot backscattered fraction can cause 12% σap overestimation.
• The other hypotheses had smaller impacts (less than 8%).
