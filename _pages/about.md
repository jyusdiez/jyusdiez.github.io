I am an atmospheric scientist interested in optical and physicial properties of aerosol particles. My research includes the analysis of light-absorbing aerosols, mainly black carbon, organic particles (ambient and lab-generated) and mineral dsut. I have been involved in testing reference aerosol absorption techniques through photo-thermal interferometry and the developement of novel correction schemes using state-of-the art techniques and machine learning approaches.

I received my PhD in Physics from the University of Barcelona in 2022, with a focus on the variability of optical properties of aerosol particles. Between 2018 and 2022 I was a PhD student at [IDAEA-CSIC](https://www.idaea.csic.es/research-group/environmental-geochemistry-and-atmospheric-research-egar/), where I was co-responsible for the maintenance and operation of three measurement sites: Barcelona, Montseny and Montsec d'Ares. There I studied the effects of the artefacts introduced by filter-photometers (AE33) for measuring absorption, and the absorbing characteristics of aerosols at the Mediterranean basin as well as from mineral dust from the Sahara.

I moved for an international postdoc to the University of Nova Gorica, in Slovenia. There, I held a MSCA fellowship from 2023 to 2025 as part of the MSCA COFUND project [SMASH](https://smash.ung.si/fellows/), focused on the study and applications of machine learning techniques to improve the characterization of the absorption properties of aerosols. As part of my fellowship, I went for an international secondment to the University of Alberta, where I evaluated the changes in the absorption properties of soot emitted from different biomass samples representative of boreal forests. I also carried out a intersectoral secondment at Haze Instruments d.o.o. in Ljubljan, where reference traceably calibrated instruments for the measurement of light absorption are developed. After my fellowship, I secured a position as an assitant professor at the University of Nova Gorica, where I continue to expand my research line on aerosol characterization.
